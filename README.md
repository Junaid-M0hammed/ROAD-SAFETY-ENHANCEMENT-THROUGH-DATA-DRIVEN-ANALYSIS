In this project, we delve into the complexities of traffic accidents, exploring causes, severity factors, and future trends. Through extensive literature analysis and meta-studies, we identify crucial elements such as driver behavior, road conditions, vehicle attributes, and environmental impacts. Additionally, we investigate the potential of emerging technologies like driverless vehicles and smart transportation networks, alongside the effectiveness of regulations and public awareness campaigns. Emphasizing data-driven approaches, we propose using advanced statistical analysis, machine learning, and predictive models to create personalized alert systems. Our multidisciplinary framework advocates integrating technical innovations, regulatory reforms, and data-driven initiatives to significantly enhance road safety, aiding policymakers, and stakeholders in informed decision-making for safer roads.
